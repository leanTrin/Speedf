# Speedf ( Speed-d-f )

## Introduction
this is a program that tells you how long it takes to read a pdf

This python program takes only 1 command line argument and that is
the pdf that the person wants to read. It then gives the user sample
text to read and calculates the words per minute. It then goes through
the pdf and tries to figure out how long the user can read the pdf
